### Research Articles
- **SxIP binding disrupts the constitutive homodimer interface of EB1 and stabilizes EB1 monomer**  
  - Abstract: SxIP is a microtubule tip localizing signal found in many +TIP proteins that bind to the hydrophobic cavity of the C-terminal domain of end binding protein 1 (EB1) and then positively regulate the microtubule plus-end tracking of EBs. However, the exact mechanism of microtubule activation of EBs in the presence of SxIP signaling motif is not known. Here, we studied the effect of SxIP peptide on the native conformation of EB1 in solution. Using various NMR experiments, we found that SxIP peptide promoted the dissociation of natively formed EB1 dimer. We also discovered that I224A mutation of EB1 resulted in an unfolded C-terminal domain, which upon binding with the SxIP motif folded to its native structure. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed the relative structural stability of EB1 monomer in the SxIP bound state. Residual dipolar couplings and heteronuclear NOE analysis suggested that the binding of SxIP peptide at the C-terminal domain of EB1 decreased the dynamics and conformational flexibility of the N-terminal domain involved in EB1-microtubule interaction. The SxIP-induced disruption of the dimeric interactions in EB1, coupled with the reduction in conformational flexibility of the N-terminal domain of EB1, might facilitate the microtubule association of EB1.

- **Time-dependent atomistic simulations of the CP29 light-harvesting complex**
  - Abstract: Light harvesting as the first step in photosynthesis is of prime importance for life on earth. For a theoretical description of photochemical processes during light harvesting, spectral densities are key quantities. They serve as input functions for modeling the excitation energy transfer dynamics and spectroscopic properties. Herein, a recently developed procedure is applied to determine the spectral densities of the pigments in the minor antenna complex CP29 of photosystem II, which has recently gained attention because of its active role in non-photochemical quenching processes in higher plants. To this end, the density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) method has been employed to enable simulation of the ground state dynamics in a quantum-mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme for each chlorophyll pigment. Subsequently, the time-dependent extension of the long-range corrected DFTB approach has been used to obtain the excitation energy fluctuations along the ground-state trajectories also in a QM/MM setting. From these results, the spectral densities have been determined and compared for different force fields and to spectral densities from other light-harvesting complexes. In addition, time-dependent and time-independent excitonic Hamiltonians of the system have been constructed and applied to the determination of absorption spectra as well as exciton dynamics.

- **Spectral densities and absorption spectra of the core antenna complex CP43 from photosystem II**
  - Abstract: Besides absorbing light, the core antenna complex CP43 of photosystem II is of great importance in transferring excitation energy from the antenna complexes to the reaction center. Excitation energies, spectral densities, and linear absorption spectra of the complex have been evaluated by a multiscale approach. In this scheme, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations are performed employing the parameterized density functional tight binding (DFTB) while the time-dependent long-range-corrected DFTB scheme is applied for the excited state calculations. The obtained average spectral density of the CP43 complex shows a very good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the excitonic Hamiltonian of the system along with the computed site-dependent spectral densities was used to determine the linear absorption. While a Redfield-like approximation has severe shortcomings in dealing with the CP43 complex due to quasi-degenerate states, the non-Markovian full second-order cumulant expansion formalism is able to overcome the drawbacks. Linear absorption spectra were obtained, which show a good agreement with the experimental counterparts at different temperatures. This study once more emphasizes that by combining diverse techniques from the areas of molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry, and open quantum systems, it is possible to obtain first-principle results for photosynthetic complexes, which are in accord with experimental findings.

  - Abstract: In this study, the site energy fluctuations, energy transfer dynamics, and some spectroscopic properties of the minor light-harvesting complex CP24 in a membrane environment were determined. For this purpose, a 3 μs-long classical molecular dynamics simulation was performed for the CP24 complex. Furthermore, using the density functional tight binding/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics (DFTB/MM MD) approach, we performed excited state calculations for the chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b molecules in the complex starting from five different positions of the MD trajectory. During the extended simulations, we observed variations in the site energies of the different sets as a result of the fluctuating protein environment. In particular, a water coordination to Chl-b 608 occurred only after about 1 μs in the simulations, demonstrating dynamic changes in the environment of this pigment. From the classical and the DFTB/MM MD simulations, spectral densities and the (time-dependent) Hamiltonian of the complex were determined. Based on these results, three independent strongly coupled chlorophyll clusters were revealed within the complex. In addition, absorption and fluorescence spectra were determined together with the exciton relaxation dynamics, which reasonably well agrees with experimental time scales.
